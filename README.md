## Synopsis

DZCdatabase is a DB for storing information on factions, units, and weapons for the table top game Dropzone Commander.  This was done for my Databases class, where I was studing relational DB.  It is disorganized as I rushed to get as much complete prior to the final for that class, but it does allow a user to complete the basic CRUD commands.

## Built with

PHP, MySQL
